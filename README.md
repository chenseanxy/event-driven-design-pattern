# Event Driven Behavioral Design

*But mainly just event loop* 

This is my presentation for *Software Archiecture* in fall 2019. 

A live version of the slides is available at https://event-talk.chenxy.tech/

The talk is hevaily inspired by Jake Archibald's talk: [In the Loop at JSConf.Asia 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCOL7MC4Pl0). This talk takes a much shallower dive into the general principals behind event loops rather than a specific JS event loop, as the talk is intended for mostly non-js developers.

Slides are implemented with [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) & [GSAP](https://github.com/greensock/GSAP).

This is my first real JS project (& HTML, CSS project for that matter). The code is really messy for the earlier slides, but gets mostly tolerable at the "Event Loop in Action" part.
